So, I've been polishing the pistons with WD40/wet and dry for a little while now and I think I've got all the crud off that I need to. Unfortunately I have found some pinholes of rust that have left pits which means that I will need to replace all of the pistons.<br /><br />I've tried to capture the pit on the rear caliper piston in this photo. Sorry it's a bit blurry, I really need to get a macro lens for close up shots like this.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dfk1rcPTISY/WVio5Q6xL6I/AAAAAAAC9dg/wyd8caGAuQkYL9zOUmhdh5ActWljNiM8QCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20170702_090207.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1446" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dfk1rcPTISY/WVio5Q6xL6I/AAAAAAAC9dg/wyd8caGAuQkYL9zOUmhdh5ActWljNiM8QCKgBGAs/s320/IMG_20170702_090207.jpg" width="289" /></a></div><br />Still I am glad that I tried to clean them up first as I could have saved some money if they had been okay, and I know how to clean the pistons on my other bikes too.<br /><br />okay, I'm off to order the parts now, and then I can reassemble the calipers and it's on to the front forks.<br /><div><br /></div>
